# Flow Free Solver

Project work for COMP20003_2022_SM2 Algorithms and Data Structures.

"In this programming assignment youâ€™ll be expected to build a solver for the Flow Free game. [...] The code in this assignment was adapted from the open-source terminal version made available by mzucker."

## Running the Project

- Download repository
- Run `make`
- Run `./flow` to show options
- Solve a puzzle
  - For example: `./flow -d -A -F puzzles/jumbo_11x11_07.txt` to fast animate the solving of jumbo_11x11_07 with deadend pruning.
